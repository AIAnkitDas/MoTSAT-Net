# MoTSAT-Net
## This work is currently under review, submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements of the Degree of Master of Science at The University of Glasgow.
## The University of Glasgow examiners have exclusive access to the OneDrive repository which temporarily hosts the robust findings - both quantitative as well as qualitative results along with Notebooks and model weights.
## We look forward to publishing this original research work - Original code will be available post peer-review process and on receiving a publication decision.

### MoTSAT-Net is a Polyp Segmentation Network which is trainable from scratch, and achieves SOTA performance on sophisticated Polyp datasets. It has MobileViT-integrated with novel TLS attention within a U-Net style Deep Neural Network, implemented using PyTorch.
