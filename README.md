# MoTSAT-Net
## This work is currently under review with IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering.

## Original code will be available post peer-review process and on receiving a publication decision.

### MoTSAT-Net is a Polyp Segmentation Network which is trainable from scratch, and achieves SOTA performance on sophisticated Polyp datasets. It has MobileViT-integrated with novel TLS attention within a U-Net style Deep Neural Network, implemented using PyTorch.
